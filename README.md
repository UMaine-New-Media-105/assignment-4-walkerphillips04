 Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/vCjH6laFW. For this first part I set up a sprite as a star using ovals and rotating them on
 their axis so I could make it look like a star. I also did no stroke to not have the overlapping visible.  one I set up the function I just manually called 
 it a few times and moved the stars locations.  I tired to play with the random variable so each new star would have a different amoint of points, but I was
 unable to. I plan to keep working on it for the upcoming parts of this assignment.
