 Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/vCjH6laFW. For this first part I set up a sprite as a star using ovals and rotating them on
 their axis so I could make it look like a star. I also did no stroke to not have the overlapping visible.  one I set up the function I just manually called 
 it a few times and moved the stars locations.  I tired to play with the random variable so each new star would have a different amoint of points, but I was unable to. I plan to keep working on it for the upcoming parts of this assignment.

Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/MsPzcs8nt. For this part I was stuck on using code from the previous question. I even played with different colors for each star before using the proper Nested Loop method so I just commented out lines 13 through 17 just in case I wanted to use it at a later time. I was a little confused with this question because I had seen some others examples and they were all a little different but mine is a prefect grid. After reading the assignment fourth document I see challenge three and how to make it randomized and I will properly implement that into my third version of this code. 

Question 3: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/-yttSedBb. For This part I created a smaller set of stars anc changes how many points they had. I figured out the randomized colors but I continued to play with the location of that code and that is how I got to having the let random color array three different times in my code.  For somereason I could not figure out how to get the randomized points of each star to work but I will be sure to implement that into the last part of the assignment.
