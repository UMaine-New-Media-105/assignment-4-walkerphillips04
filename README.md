 Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/vCjH6laFW. For this first part I set up a sprite as a star using ovals and rotating them on
 their axis so I could make it look like a star. I also did no stroke to not have the overlapping visible.  one I set up the function I just manually called 
 it a few times and moved the stars locations.  I tired to play with the random variable so each new star would have a different amoint of points, but I was unable to. I plan to keep working on it for the upcoming parts of this assignment.

Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/MsPzcs8nt. For this part I was stuck on using code from the previous question. I even played with different colors for each star before using the proper Nested Loop method so I just commented out lines 13 through 17 just in case I wanted to use it at a later time. I was a little confused with this question because I had seen some others examples and they were all a little different but mine is a prefect grid. After reading the assignment fourth document I see challenge three and how to make it randomized and I will properly implement that into my third version of this code. 

Question 3: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/-yttSedBb. For This part I created a smaller set of stars anc changes how many points they had. I figured out the randomized colors but I continued to play with the location of that code and that is how I got to having the let random color array three different times in my code.  For somereason I could not figure out how to get the randomized points of each star to work but I will be sure to implement that into the last part of the assignment. 

Question 4: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/rRB7zMe8N. For this part I had to change some things for It to look the way I wanted it to. Now the background it black so the violet stars show up and both the smaller and larger stars change the amount of points they have but only the smaller stars have a random variable for how large they can get.  I couldn't get the rainbow colors to work diagonally but I like how the colors go from right to left and then top to bottom, it creates a cool pattern.  I think I liked the randomness of question 3s' colors but I Like how I set up the array with the basic colors of the rainbow.
